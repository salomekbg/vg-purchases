# vg-purchases

This is the repository for my web app, VG Purchases.  This is to keep an inventory of all the games you own, what platforms they are for and where you've purchased them from.  Personally, at times I find multiple digital copies of the same game because I've bought them from different sources.  Alternatively, sometimes I can't remember if I already have the game for a specific console or PC.  This web app is built to resolve that issue.

I am using Rails 5, HTML 5 and CSS 3.
